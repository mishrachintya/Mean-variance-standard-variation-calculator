# Mean-variance-standard-variation-calculator 
(Numpy based mean, variance and standard variation calculator)
I've developed this calculator as a project assignment on freecodecamp.org where I'm learning Data Analytics with Python

Here I've created a function named calculate() that uses Numpy to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.

If a list containing less than 9 elements is passed into the function, it will raise a ValueError exception with the message: "List must contain nine numbers." The values in the returned dictionary are lists and not Numpy arrays.

I've added some test cases by myself to check the working of the calculator. The test cases are imported into the main.py file.

All the files and the test cases will be attached
